I am an undergraduate student majoring in Optical Engineering and minoring in Physics at the University of Rochester. My primary research interests are in experimental quantum optics and engineering. Currently I work as an undergraduate research assistant for the Nichol Group in the Department of Physics.

Outside of academics, I am an avid reader, sing classically, and enjoy a variety of writing. If you are interested in reading some of my work, please check out the writing page on this site.

If you would like to get in contact with me, please check out the contact page on this site. Thanks for stopping by!
